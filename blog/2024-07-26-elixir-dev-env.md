Now that I have a somewhat usable setup, it's time I'd get myself an IDE I'm comfortable working with.

I know it's trendy, but I'm not _Vim_ person (the only command I know is `:q` so that I'm able to quit it as soon as possible): because I'm so used to Visual Studio - all its quirks, but also all its features - I wish for something that mimicks this the best.

After a bit of research, it seems like the only two options worth exploring are _VSCode_ and _JetBrains_, customized with the correct plugins obviously! Fortunately both of these solutions are platform-agnostic. I'm primarily using Windows as my development OS, but from times to times I find myself on a Linux machine. I want my setup to work on Linux as well.

## Visual Studio Code

## JetBrains IDE
