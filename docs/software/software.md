## Executable Compiler Detection

* [Exeinfo PE by ASL](https://github.com/ExeinfoASL/ASL): this one was the best I could find for Windows PE files (it detected that some exe had been built by zig); however it doesn't say much about ELF.
* [Detect it Easy](https://github.com/horsicq/Detect-It-Easy): a very good one, handles ELF, however did not detect my zig-compiled executable. Still valuable
* [Language 2000](https://farrokhi.net/language/): works on Windows, but as its name implies does not give much information for anything built in the 21st century...
* [PEiD](https://www.aldeid.com/wiki/PEiD): couldn't test because it has SentinelOne pop many threat alerts...
