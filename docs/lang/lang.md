# Programming languages

## Native / Low level

* [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
* [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) - General-purpose programming language and toolchain for maintaining robust, optimal and reusable software (_aka a better C_)
* [V](https://vlang.io/) - Simple, fast, safe, compiled. For developing maintainable software
    > Go-like
    >
    > ```v
    > fn main() {
    >     areas := ['game', 'web', 'tools', 'science', 'systems',
    >               'embedded', 'drivers', 'GUI', 'mobile']
    >     for area in areas {
    >         println('Hello, $area developers!')
    >     }
    > }
    > ```

* [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/)

    > ```ruby
    > if rand(2) > 0
    > my_string = "hello world"
    > end
    >
    > puts my_string.upcase
    > ```
    >
    > gives:
    >
    > ```sh
    > $ crystal hello_world.cr
    > Error in hello_world.cr:5: undefined method 'upcase' for Nil (compile-time type is (String | Nil))
    >
    > puts my_string.upcase
    > ```
    >
    > * Ruby-like, statically type checked, built-in type inference
    > * C-bindings
    > * Null representation: union between the type and nil

* [Odin](https://odin-lang.org/) - Odin is a general-purpose programming language with distinct typing built for high performance, modern systems and data-oriented programming. Odin is the C alternative for the Joy of Programming.
    >
    > ```odin
    > package main
    > 
    > import "core:fmt"
    > 
    > main :: proc() {
    > program := "+ + * ðŸ˜ƒ - /"
    > accumulator := 0  
    > for token in program {
    >     switch token {
    >     case '+': accumulator += 1
    >     case '-': accumulator -= 1
    >     case '*': accumulator *= 2
    >     case '/': accumulator /= 2
    >     case 'ðŸ˜ƒ': accumulator *= accumulator
    >     case: // Ignore everything else
    >     }
    > } 
    > fmt.printf("The program \"%s\" calculates the value %d\n",
    >             program, accumulator)
    > }
    > ```

* [Beef](https://www.beeflang.org/) - Performance-oriented compiled language built hand-in-hand with its IDE environment

    > **C#-like**, but compiles to native
    >
    > Comes with a Graphical IDE (Windows-only for now):
    > ![beef-ide]()
    >
    > ```csharp
    > using System;
    > 
    > namespace Hello {
    >     class Program {
    >         static void Main() {
    >             Console.WriteLine("Hello, world!");
    >         }
    >     }
    > }
    > ```

* [Kit](https://www.kitlang.org/) - A magical, high performance programming language for game development

    > ```js
    > include "stdio.h";
    >
    > function main() {
    >     var s: CString = "Hello from Kit!";
    >     printf("%s\n", s);
    > }
    > ```
    >
    > * Kit has a strong, static type system to catch errors at compile-time.
    > * Kit is a procedural language, not object-oriented or functional; however, traits, boxes and abstracts can simulate object-oriented interfaces and polymorphism.
    > * Kit compiles to standard C, which then compiles to native libraries or executables.
    > * Memory management in Kit is manual (no automatic garbage collection), with some convenience features to make this easier.

## With VM / Interpreted / GC / Higher level

* [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/) - statically typed compiled systems programming language

    > It combines successful concepts from mature languages like Python, Ada and Modula.
    >
    > * Python-like
    > * Inspiration from Ada and modula
    > * Modern type system with local type inference, tuples, generics and sum types.
    > * Nim's memory management is deterministic and customizable with destructors and move semantics, inspired by C++ and Rust.
    >
    > ```nim
    > import strformat
    >
    > type
    >   Person = object
    >     name: string
    >     age: Natural # Ensures the age is positive
    >
    > let people = [
    >   Person(name: "John", age: 45),
    >   Person(name: "Kate", age: 30)
    > ]
    >
    > for person in people:
    >   # Type-safe string interpolation,
    >   # evaluated at compile time.
    >   echo(fmt"{person.name} is {person.age} years old")
    > ```

* [Pony](https://www.ponylang.io/) - Open-source, object-oriented, actor-model, capabilities-secure, high-performance programming language.

    > ```pony
    > actor Main
    >   new create(env: Env) =>
    >     env.out.print("Hello, world!")
    > ```
