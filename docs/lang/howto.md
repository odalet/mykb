## Robert Nystrom's Crafting Interpreters

![Robert Nystrom's Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/image/header.png)

> A whole book that implements a (not so) simple interpreter in Java then in C: <https://craftinginterpreters.com/contents.html/>
>
> The language is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports:
>
> * Data Types: booleans, numbers, strings and nil
> * Arithmetic and comparison and logical operators
> * Control flow: `if`, `while`, `for`
> * Functions and Closures
> * Classes with constructor (`init()`), dynamic fields and single (non-virtual) inheritance
>
> The language comes in two different implementations:
>
> * Java-based 'Tree-walking' implementation that reiles on Java's GC for memory management. It's slow, but easy to implement and debug.
> * C implementation: this one adds a bytecode into which the is AST is compiled that gets executed on a VM. The VM provides its own GC.

> Tutorial Language by **Immo Landwerth** [GitHub](https://github.com/terrajobst), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/terrajobst)
>
> The language is incrementally live-coded on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRAdsfhKI4OWNOSfS7EUu5GRAVmze1t2y). Each [episode](https://github.com/terrajobst/minsk/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+label%3Aepisode+sort%3Acreated-asc) is associated with a commit and notes.
>
> The language is strictly-typed. It compiles down to **MSIL**.
